# Tests for OS Exercise 5, Exercise 2022 - Container implementation

## Requirements

These tests should work in Linux systems including the school's VM (though not tested there), and on Windows with WSL2.
In addition, your system must have `python3` and `pip3` installed.

## Instructions

### Before running the tests: 
   * Make sure your *container* binary is named `container`, and is placed at the parent directory of the current one. That is, make sure it's placed inside the project's root directory.
   * Make sure your *image* directory is named `image` and is placed at the project's root directory as well.
   * Make sure you have root privileges on the system you're operating, as the container requires it to be able to run.

<br />

1. From your project's root, perform `git clone https://github.com/danhuji/tests_os_ex5 tests`

2. `cd tests`

3. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` (You're encouraged to run it within a virtual environment)

4. Run the test suite: `sudo -E python3 -m pytest test_containers.py`
