# Tests for OS Exercise 5, Exercise 2022 - Container implementation

## Requirements

These tests should work in Linux systems including the Aquarium, and on Windows with WSL2.
In addition, your system must have `python3` installed.

I haven't tested them on Mac or with normal Windows, and I have no idea if they work there. If you're having problems and you're sure you followed
the instructions, try them on the Aquarium.

## Installation instructions

### Before running the tests: 
   * Make sure your *container* binary is named `container`, and is placed at the parent directory of the curret one. That is, make sure it's placed inside the project's root directory.
   * Make sure your *image* directory is named `image` and is placed at the project's root directory as well.

<br />

1. From your project's root, perform `git clone https://github.com/danhuji/tests_os_ex5 tests`

2. `cd tests`

3. `pip install -r requirements.txt` (You're encouraged to run it within a virtual environment)

4. Run the test suite: `sudo -E python3 -m pytest test_containers.py`
